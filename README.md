# TypingSpeedTest
Users have to input the text that is in the HTML index page
and it automatically starts a timer as soon as it detects a
keypress and also calculates the WPM simultaneously (without
including the backspace).

This is a project that I started when watching the LinkedIn
Learning course on JavaScript, however started tweaking it further
with the WPM calculator.
